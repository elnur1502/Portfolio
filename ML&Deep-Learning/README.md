Deep Learning projects

All of these projects work on Pytorch (https://pytorch.org).

1) FFN project: In this project I have used FeedForwardNetwork for non-binary classification problem. Dataset: AG NEWS
2) CNN project: Convolutional Neural Network for image classification. Dataset: CIFAR-10
3) RNN project: Recurrent Neural Network for classification (positive/negative). Dataset: IMDB reviews
4) Autoencoders project: Dataset: CIFAR-10
5) VAE project: Variational Autoencoder for digits generation. Dataset: MNIST
6) DBN project: Deep Belief Network for non-binary classification. Dataset: Fashion Mnist. DBN_project.pdf is the description of what I have done in this project.
